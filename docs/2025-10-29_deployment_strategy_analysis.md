# Deployment Strategy Analysis - October 29, 2025

## Current Situation

We have four Linear issues that need sequencing:
- **TT-28:** Automated integration tests for backend API
- **TT-20:** Docker Compose for local development
- **TT-27:** Frontend-backend integration
- **TT-23:** CI/CD pipeline and ECS deployment

## Key Question: Should we merge TT-20 and TT-27?

### Analysis: TT-20 vs TT-27 Overlap

**TT-20 Focus:**
- Docker Compose configuration for local dev
- Hot reload for development
- Service networking
- Volume mounts for live code changes
- Developer experience optimization

**TT-27 Focus:**
- Frontend code changes (API integration)
- End-to-end testing with containers
- Verification steps for data flow
- Database query verification
- Production-ready validation

**Overlap:**
- Both need docker-compose.yml
- Both involve running all three services together
- Both test inter-service communication

**Differences:**
- TT-20: Development workflow (hot reload, live editing)
- TT-27: Production validation (containerized testing, no live editing)

### Recommendation: **MERGE TT-20 and TT-27**

**Why:**
1. **Single docker-compose.yml serves both purposes** - Can support hot reload AND production testing
2. **Avoids duplicate work** - Creating two different compose files is wasteful
3. **Better workflow** - Developers use same environment for dev and testing
4. **Realistic testing** - Testing in same environment we develop in

**Merged Issue Focus:**
- Create docker-compose.yml with profiles (dev vs test)
- Implement frontend API integration
- Support both hot reload development AND containerized testing
- Document both workflows

---

## Proposed Deployment Workflow

### Option A: Deploy Backend First (RECOMMENDED)

```
TT-28 (Tests) → TT-23 (Backend Deploy) → TT-20+27 (Integration) → TT-23 (Full Deploy)
```

**Sequence:**
1. **TT-28:** Create automated backend tests (3-4 hours)
   - Verify backend works correctly in isolation
   - Create test scripts for CI/CD
   - Ensure quality before deployment

2. **TT-23 (Backend Only):** Deploy backend to ECS (4-6 hours)
   - Create GitHub Actions workflow
   - Push backend image to ECR
   - Deploy backend to ECS Fargate
   - Connect to RDS production database
   - Verify backend health in AWS

3. **TT-20+27 (Merged):** Frontend integration + Docker Compose (6-8 hours)
   - Create docker-compose.yml (dev + test profiles)
   - Implement frontend API integration
   - Test locally against deployed backend
   - Test locally with local backend
   - Verify end-to-end functionality

4. **TT-23 (Frontend):** Deploy frontend to ECS (2-3 hours)
   - Update GitHub Actions for frontend
   - Push frontend image to ECR
   - Deploy frontend to ECS Fargate
   - Update ALB routing
   - Full production verification

**Total Time:** ~17-21 hours

---

### Option B: Local Integration First (Traditional)

```
TT-28 (Tests) → TT-20+27 (Integration) → TT-23 (Full Deploy)
```

**Sequence:**
1. **TT-28:** Create automated backend tests (3-4 hours)
2. **TT-20+27 (Merged):** Full local integration (6-8 hours)
3. **TT-23:** Deploy both services to ECS (6-9 hours)

**Total Time:** ~15-21 hours

---

## Final Decision (Updated October 29, 2025 - End of Day)

After completing TT-28 (automated testing) and careful analysis of both TT-20 and TT-23, we have **finalized the deployment strategy**:

### Selected Approach: Backend-First Deployment

**Sequence:**
```
TT-23 (Backend Deploy) → TT-20 (Local Dev) → TT-23b (Frontend Deploy)
```

### Rationale for Backend-First

**Why TT-23 before TT-20:**

1. **Validate Production Infrastructure Early**
   - Test RDS connectivity in real AWS environment
   - Identify security group, VPC, subnet issues early
   - Verify AWS Secrets Manager integration works
   - De-risks infrastructure before frontend complexity

2. **Portfolio Value During Job Search**
   - Show working backend API in production immediately
   - Demonstrate AWS deployment skills
   - Can reference live API in interviews: https://davidshaevel.com/api/health
   - Faster time to portfolio demonstration (hours vs days)

3. **TT-20 Prerequisites Satisfied**
   - TT-20 describes: "TT-23a: Backend deployed to ECS (can test against remote backend)"
   - TT-20 specifically mentions: "Can switch between local and remote backend"
   - The real value of TT-20 comes AFTER you have a deployed backend

4. **Lower Deployment Risk**
   - Smaller, incremental deployment
   - Isolate backend issues before frontend integration
   - Easier troubleshooting with clear error boundaries
   - Backend logs isolated from frontend

5. **Realistic Testing Enabled**
   - After TT-23: Frontend can test against real deployed backend (in TT-20)
   - Catch environment-specific issues early
   - More realistic than only local testing
   - Validates CORS configuration in real environment

6. **No CI/CD Complexity**
   - TT-23 scope clarified: Manual deployment only (no GitHub Actions)
   - Estimated time reduced from 6-8 hours to 3-4 hours
   - GitHub Actions CI/CD deferred to future enhancement
   - Focus on getting backend running in production quickly

### Implementation Plan

**TT-23: Deploy Backend to ECS (3-4 hours) - IMMEDIATE NEXT STEP**
- Create ECR repository for backend (30 min)
- Build and push backend Docker image to ECR (30 min)
- Update Terraform compute module with ECR image URI (1 hour)
- Deploy backend to ECS Fargate via Terraform apply (automated)
- Verify health checks passing on ALB (1 hour)
- Test API via https://davidshaevel.com/api/health
- **Deliverable:** Working backend API in production ✅

**TT-20: Local Development Environment (4-6 hours) - AFTER TT-23**
- Create Docker Compose configuration
- PostgreSQL + Frontend + Backend containers
- Verify frontend makes API calls to backend
- Test full-stack locally
- **New capability:** Can test frontend locally against deployed AWS backend
- **New capability:** Validate CORS configuration end-to-end

**TT-23b: Deploy Frontend to ECS (Future)**
- After TT-20 frontend integration is complete
- Deploy frontend to ECS
- Full-stack application live

### Why Not TT-20 First?

The original analysis suggested TT-20 first for these reasons:

❌ **"Local Testing First" - Not as valuable without deployed backend**
- Local testing is useful, but lacks production environment validation
- Can't test against real RDS, real Secrets Manager, real security groups
- Misses opportunity for early infrastructure validation

❌ **"Cheaper to Debug" - Marginal benefit**
- Backend already tested locally (TT-28 automated tests)
- Infrastructure issues only appear in AWS, not locally
- Docker Compose can't catch VPC, security group, or IAM issues

❌ **"Consistency with Documentation" - Documentation updated**
- All documentation now reflects TT-23 first approach
- Linear issues aligned with backend-first strategy

### Note on This Document

This document captures the **strategic analysis** performed during the October 29, 2025 session. Both the complex 4-phase approach (Option A) and the simpler linear approach were thoroughly analyzed.

The **final decision** after end-of-day review: **Backend-first deployment (TT-23 → TT-20 → TT-23b)**

This maximizes portfolio value, de-risks AWS infrastructure early, and provides faster time to working demonstration.
