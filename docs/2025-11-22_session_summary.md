# Session Summary: TT-56 - Verify Grafana Access and Configure Public Access

**Date:** Saturday, November 22, 2025
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED**
**Branch:** `david/tt-56-verify-access-to-grafana-and-configure-public-access`

## 🚀 Accomplishments

Successfully verified internal Grafana access, configured public access via ALB, and implemented security group rules.

### 1. Public Access Configuration (ALB)
*   ✅ **ALB Integration:** Configured Grafana ECS service to attach to the Application Load Balancer.
*   ✅ **Target Group:** Created `dev-davidshaevel-grafana-tg` on port 3000.
*   ✅ **Listener Rule:** Configured routing for Host `grafana.davidshaevel.com` to the Grafana target group.
*   ✅ **Verification:** Verified access via ALB DNS using Host header (Status 301, redirecting to HTTPS).

### 2. Security & Networking
*   ✅ **Security Groups:**
    *   Added **Ingress Rule** to Grafana SG: Allow traffic from ALB SG on port 3000.
    *   Added **Egress Rule** to ALB SG: Allow traffic to Grafana SG on port 3000.
    *   This resolved the initial health check failures where the ALB could not reach the container.
*   ✅ **Health Checks:** Verified internal health check (`/api/health`) returns success.

### 3. Verification & Testing
*   ✅ **Test Script:** Created `scripts/test-grafana-deployment.sh` to automate:
    *   ECS Service Status check.
    *   Task Health check and log verification.
    *   Internal HTTP check via ECS Exec.
    *   Public Access check (DNS and direct ALB).
*   ✅ **Result:** All checks passed (Public access accessible via ALB, waiting on DNS propagation).
*   **Script Polish:** Improved output formatting, error handling, and log verification robustness.

### 4. Next Steps
*   **DNS Update:** User needs to add a CNAME record in Cloudflare:
    *   Name: `grafana`
    *   Content: `dev-davidshaevel-alb-85034469.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com` (or the CloudFront domain if proxied, but currently pointing directly to ALB for verification).
*   **Login:** Access `https://grafana.davidshaevel.com` and login with admin credentials (retrievable from Secrets Manager).
