# TT-28 Session Notes - October 29, 2025

## Strategy Update

Successfully reorganized Linear issues based on backend-first deployment strategy:

### Linear Issue Changes

1. **TT-20 (Updated):** Merged with TT-27 functionality
   - Title: "Create Docker Compose for local development and integrate frontend with backend API"
   - Scope: Single docker-compose.yml for both development (hot reload) and testing
   - Status: Todo (will start after TT-23a)

2. **TT-27 (Canceled):** Marked as duplicate
   - Functionality merged into TT-20
   - Avoids duplicate work

3. **TT-23 (Updated):** Renamed to Phase 1
   - Title: "Deploy backend to ECS Fargate (Phase 1: Backend Only)"
   - Scope: Backend deployment in isolation
   - Status: Todo (next after TT-28)

4. **TT-29 (Created):** New issue for Phase 2
   - Title: "Deploy frontend to ECS Fargate (Phase 2: Complete Full-Stack)"
   - Scope: Frontend deployment after integration complete
   - Status: Backlog

5. **TT-28 (In Progress):** Automated integration tests
   - Status: In Progress (implementing now)

### Deployment Strategy Approved

**Sequence:**
```
TT-28 (Tests) → TT-23 (Backend Deploy) → TT-20 (Integration) → TT-29 (Frontend Deploy)
```

**Benefits:**
- Lower risk with incremental deployment
- Early AWS/RDS validation
- Better portfolio value (deployed backend during job search)
- Industry best practices (microservices pattern)
- Easier troubleshooting

## TT-28 Implementation Progress

### Completed

✅ **Created `/Users/dshaevel/workspace-ds/davidshaevel-platform/backend/scripts/test-local.sh`**

**Features Implemented:**
- Full script structure with proper error handling
- Docker container management (PostgreSQL + Backend)
- 14 comprehensive automated tests:
  1. Health check (DB connected) - 200 OK
  2. Health check shows error details in dev mode
  3. Metrics endpoint - Prometheus format
  4. Create project with native array
  5. Get project by ID
  6. Update project (optimized query)
  7. Get all projects
  8. Invalid UUID validation - 400
  9. Missing required fields - 400
  10. Delete project - 204
  11. Native text[] array type verification
  12. Data persistence verification
  13. Health check with DB down - 503
  14. Error details hidden in production mode

**Script Features:**
- Color-coded output (green ✓, red ✗)
- Verbose mode (`-v` or `--verbose`)
- No cleanup mode (`--no-cleanup` for debugging)
- Quiet mode (`-q` for CI/CD)
- Help menu (`-h` or `--help`)
- Proper exit codes (0 = pass, 1 = fail)
- Automatic cleanup on exit (trap EXIT)
- Dependency checking (docker, curl, jq)
- Service readiness waiting
- Tests both development and production modes

**Script Details:**
- Uses separate test containers (postgres-test, backend-test)
- Uses different port (5433) to avoid conflicts
- Tests native PostgreSQL array types
- Tests query optimization (preload)
- Tests security (error message hiding in production)
- Tests CORS configuration
- Tests UUID validation
- Tests database connectivity and error handling

### Next Steps

**Immediate (User Action Required):**
1. **START DOCKER DESKTOP** - Required to run tests
2. Run test script: `./backend/scripts/test-local.sh`
3. Verify all 14 tests pass
4. Review output and test results

**After Docker Started:**
5. Update backend README with Testing section
6. Create git branch for TT-28
7. Commit changes
8. Create Pull Request
9. Mark TT-28 as complete

## Test Script Usage

```bash
# Run all tests (default)
./backend/scripts/test-local.sh

# Verbose mode (see detailed output)
./backend/scripts/test-local.sh -v

# Skip cleanup (for debugging)
./backend/scripts/test-local.sh --no-cleanup

# Quiet mode (for CI/CD)
./backend/scripts/test-local.sh -q

# Help
./backend/scripts/test-local.sh -h
```

### Automated Integration Tests

We provide a comprehensive automated test script that verifies all backend functionality:

```bash
./backend/scripts/test-local.sh
```

**What it tests:**
- ✅ Health check endpoints (with/without database)
- ✅ Metrics endpoint (Prometheus format)
- ✅ Projects CRUD operations
- ✅ UUID validation
- ✅ Request validation
- ✅ Database integration (native PostgreSQL arrays)
- ✅ Query optimization (TypeORM preload)
- ✅ Error handling (503 status codes)
- ✅ Security (error message hiding in production)
- ✅ Development vs production mode differences

**Test Coverage:**
- 14 automated tests
- Tests both development and production modes
- Verifies database connectivity and error handling
- Validates security configurations

**Options:**
```bash
./backend/scripts/test-local.sh           # Run all tests
./backend/scripts/test-local.sh -v        # Verbose mode
./backend/scripts/test-local.sh --no-cleanup  # Keep containers for debugging
./backend/scripts/test-local.sh -q        # Quiet mode (for CI/CD)
```

**Requirements:**
- Docker Desktop running
- `curl` installed
- `jq` installed (for JSON parsing)

**CI/CD Integration:**
This script is designed to work in GitHub Actions and can be used for pre-merge validation.
```
