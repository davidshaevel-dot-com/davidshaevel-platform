- Native PostgreSQL array types (text[])
- Query optimization (preload method)
- Data persistence across operations
- Error handling when database unavailable

### Security
- CORS configuration
- Error message hiding in production
- Development vs production environment behavior
- HTTP status codes (200, 201, 204, 400, 503)

### Environment Configuration
- Development mode with detailed errors
- Production mode with hidden error details
- ConfigService integration
- Environment variable handling

---

## Technical Details

### Script Architecture

**Container Management:**
- Automatically builds backend Docker image
- Starts PostgreSQL 15 container on port 5433
- Starts backend container on port 3001
- Tests both development and production modes
- Automatic cleanup on exit (even on failure)

**Test Execution:**
- Sequential test execution with progress tracking
- Color-coded pass/fail indicators
- Test counter and success rate calculation
- Verbose logging option for debugging
- Service readiness checks before testing

**Error Handling:**
- Trap EXIT signal for cleanup
- Graceful failure messages
- Container cleanup even on script failure
- Port conflict detection
- Dependency checking (docker, curl, jq)

### Dependencies

**Required:**
- Docker Desktop (must be running)
- `curl` (HTTP requests)
- `jq` (JSON parsing)
- Bash 4.0+

**Optional:**
- PostgreSQL client (for manual database queries)

# Commit message
feat: add comprehensive automated integration tests for backend API

Implemented automated testing script with 14 comprehensive tests covering
all backend functionality including API endpoints, database integration,
security, and error handling.

Features:
- 14 automated integration tests (100% passing)
- Docker container management (PostgreSQL + Backend)
- Color-coded output for easy reading
- Multiple modes: verbose (-v), quiet (-q), no-cleanup (--no-cleanup)
- CI/CD ready with proper exit codes
- Tests both development and production modes

Test Coverage:
- 7 API endpoint tests (health, metrics, CRUD operations)
- 3 validation tests (UUID, required fields, data types)
- 2 security tests (error hiding, CORS configuration)
- 2 database integration tests (native arrays, persistence)

Documentation:
- Added comprehensive Testing section to backend README
- Documented all script options and requirements
- Included manual testing examples with curl

This establishes quality baseline for TT-23 (ECS deployment) and enables
automated testing in GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline.
