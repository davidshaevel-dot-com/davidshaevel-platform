# Build Next.js Frontend Application (TT-18)

## Summary

Complete implementation of production-ready Next.js 16 frontend application with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, health check endpoints, and Docker containerization. All TT-18 acceptance criteria met and verified.

## Changes

### API Routes
- **Health Check Endpoint** (`/api/health`): Returns 200 OK with JSON status including uptime, version, service name, and environment
- **Metrics Endpoint** (`/api/metrics`): Prometheus-compatible metrics in text format for observability

### Pages (4 total)
- **Home** (`/`): Hero section, core competencies showcase, skills grid, and CTA
- **About** (`/about`): Professional bio, technical expertise, approach to platform engineering
- **Projects** (`/projects`): Detailed showcase of this platform project with architecture, tech stack, and features
- **Contact** (`/contact`): Contact form (client-side), contact information, social links, and location

### Components
- **Navigation**: Responsive navigation bar with mobile menu support
- **Footer**: Site footer with links, social media, and copyright

### Infrastructure
- **Dockerfile**: Multi-stage build (deps → builder → runner) with Node.js 20 Alpine
- **Health Check**: Container health check for `/api/health` endpoint
- **Security**: Non-root user (nextjs:nodejs) for container runtime
- **.dockerignore**: Optimized to exclude development files and dependencies

### Documentation
- **Frontend README**: Comprehensive documentation (243 lines) covering:
  - Technology stack and features
  - Getting started guide
  - Project structure
  - API endpoint documentation
  - Docker deployment instructions
  - Production deployment architecture
  - Development guidelines

## Testing

### Local Development
```bash
✅ npm install - Dependencies installed successfully
✅ npm run build - Production build completed (9 routes generated)
✅ TypeScript compilation - No errors
✅ ESLint - All checks passed
```

### Docker Build and Runtime
```bash
✅ docker build - Image built successfully
✅ docker run - Container starts on port 3000
✅ Health check endpoint - Returns 200 OK with JSON
✅ Metrics endpoint - Returns Prometheus format
✅ Container health check - Working correctly
```

### Build Output
```
Route (app)
┌ ○ /                    # Home page (static)
├ ○ /_not-found         # 404 page (static)
├ ○ /about              # About page (static)
├ ƒ /api/health         # Health check (dynamic)
├ ƒ /api/metrics        # Metrics (dynamic)
├ ○ /contact            # Contact page (static)
└ ○ /projects           # Projects page (static)

○  (Static)   prerendered as static content
ƒ  (Dynamic)  server-rendered on demand
```

$ curl http://localhost:3000/api/health
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-28T21:55:51.468Z",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "service": "frontend",
  "uptime": 2.430967249,
  "environment": "production"
}

# Metrics
$ curl http://localhost:3000/api/metrics
# HELP frontend_uptime_seconds Application uptime in seconds
# TYPE frontend_uptime_seconds counter
frontend_uptime_seconds 12.411235518
...
```

## Deployment Readiness

### ECS Fargate Requirements Met
- ✅ Port 3000 exposed
- ✅ Health check endpoint available
- ✅ Metrics endpoint for Prometheus
- ✅ Container runs as non-root user
- ✅ Production build optimized
- ✅ Environment variables supported

### Next Steps for Deployment (TT-23)
1. Create ECR repository for frontend
2. Build and tag Docker image
3. Push image to ECR
4. Update ECS task definition with ECR image URI
5. Deploy to ECS Fargate cluster
6. Verify ALB health checks passing
7. Confirm https://davidshaevel.com serving frontend

## Screenshots

Not applicable - this is a code-only PR. Application screenshots will be available after deployment.

## Breaking Changes

None - this is a new feature (initial frontend implementation).

## Dependencies

All dependencies are production-ready and well-maintained:
- Next.js 16 (latest stable)
- React 19 (latest)
- TypeScript 5 (latest stable)
- Tailwind CSS 4 (latest)

## Checklist

## Additional Notes

### Docker Build Strategy
Multi-stage build separates concerns:
1. **deps stage**: Install production dependencies only
2. **builder stage**: Install all dependencies (including devDependencies), build app
3. **runner stage**: Copy only production assets and dependencies

This results in a minimal production image (~200MB) with optimal security and performance.

### Future Enhancements (Out of Scope for TT-18)
- Backend API integration (TT-19)
- Contact form submission to backend
- Dynamic content from database
- User authentication (if needed)
- Analytics integration
- SEO optimization with metadata
